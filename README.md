# Zen Count Blackjack Simulation

A Python simulation comparing the Zen Count card counting strategy to basic strategy in Blackjack. 
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Zen Count system in gaining an edge over the casino.

I have now also added the HiLo counting strategy. Will sophisticate the simulations over time... for now the hl_v_zen s
imulation is not where I want it to be.

A quick rundown on what the data has shown me so far:

Zen beats basic by around 2.3% on average when doing 1000 trials with 5000 iterations (hands) played each

HiLo does aroud 1.9 - 2.1%

However my data shows heads up, HiLo outperforms Zen. I am not sure why this is, but I will try and find out!
