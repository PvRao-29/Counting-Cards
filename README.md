# Zen Count Blackjack Simulation

A Python simulation comparing the Zen Count card counting strategy to basic strategy in Blackjack. 
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Zen Count system in gaining an edge over the casino.

In future I will probably add more counting strategies... maybe try to evaluate some of my own. It will be interesting to see how the strategies stack up when going head to head.
